      <h2 class="headline scroll-reveal">Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-mono scroll-reveal">Sam wished to effectively showcase the tactile and unique nature of his ceramics in a digital format. He needed both a visual design to reflect his distinctive work and a taxonomic reorganization to make his product offerings more cohesive. A more engaging and visually clarifying platform was essential to connect with potential customers.</p>
      <h2 class="headline scroll-reveal">Solution</h2>
      <p class="text-mono scroll-reveal">I redesigned and developed Sam's Shopify website to better reflect his artistic aesthetic. Additionally, I improved product descriptions and reorganized the taxonomy to clearly and logically present his unique yet similar handmade objects, enhancing the shopping experience.</p>
